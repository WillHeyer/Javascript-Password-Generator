# 03 Javascript: Password Generator
Herein, I've created a website used to generate a random password based upon the users answers to the automated questions.


# General
Based upon the Acceptance Criteria, I was able to create a password generator. The user must first click on a large red button that says Generate Password. Once this button is clicked multiple prompts asks the website user for certain answers/criteria. These include length between 8-128 characters, in accord with which of the four types of characters the user wants to include: lowercase, uppercase, numberic, and special characters. Once all prompts are answered, the user is provided a random password that is displayed on the screen.
